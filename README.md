# Silky-Hands

This Minecraft data pack allows you to enchant a player's hands with silk touch,
allowing them to obtain (almost) any block they break.
More details on [Planet Minecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/silky-hands).

## Installation

Go to the [releases](https://github.com/One-Nose/Silky-Hands/releases) page.
Each version states the compatible Minecraft versions.
Choose the latest version that is compatible with your desired Minecraft version.
From the list of assets, download `Source code (zip)`.
Then, open the downloaded `zip` file.
You will see a single folder, named something like `Silky-Hands-2.3.0`.
Copy that folder into your Minecraft world's `datapacks` folder.
